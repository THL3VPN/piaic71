## Prompt

/sp.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements

## Response snapshot

I have created the project constitution with the principles you requested. I also updated the project templates to be consistent with the new constitution.

- **Created:** `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- **Updated:** `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`

You can review the new constitution and the updated template.

I suggest the following commit message:
`docs: amend constitution to v1.1.0 (principle additions + governance update)`
