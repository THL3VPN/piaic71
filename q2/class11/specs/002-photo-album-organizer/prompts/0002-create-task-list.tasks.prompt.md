## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have created the task list for the Photo Album Organizer feature. The `tasks.md` file has been generated in the feature's specification directory.

- **Task List:** `specs/002-photo-album-organizer/tasks.md`

**Summary:**
- **Total Tasks:** 20
- **User Story 1 Tasks:** 5
- **User Story 2 Tasks:** 3
- **User Story 3 Tasks:** 3
- **MVP Scope:** User Story 1 (5 tasks)

The tasks are now ready for implementation. You can now run `/sp.implement` to start working on the tasks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed and actionable task list for the feature.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of generating the task list from the design artifacts was successful.
