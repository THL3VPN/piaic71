## Prompt

/sp.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan for the Photo Album Organizer feature. The following artifacts have been generated:

- **Implementation Plan:** `specs/002-photo-album-organizer/plan.md`
- **Research:** `specs/002-photo-album-organizer/research.md`
- **Data Model:** `specs/002-photo-album-organizer/data-model.md`

The plan is now ready for the next phase. You can now run `/sp.tasks` to generate the tasks for this feature.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created implementation plan and design artifacts.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 3 files created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating the implementation plan and design artifacts was successful.
