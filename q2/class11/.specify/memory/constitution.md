### III. User Experience Consistency
A consistent and intuitive user experience is paramount. All user-facing components should adhere to the project's design system and UX guidelines.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must meet defined performance benchmarks. Code should be optimized for speed and efficiency to ensure a responsive user experience.

## Development Workflow

All development must follow the established workflow, including code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration.

## Governance
