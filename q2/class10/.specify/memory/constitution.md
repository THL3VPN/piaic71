# Gemini CLI Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must be written to be clear, maintainable, and efficient. Adherence to established coding standards and best practices is mandatory. Code should be self-documenting where possible, with comments reserved for explaining 'why', not 'what'.

### II. Comprehensive Testing
A robust suite of tests must accompany all code contributions. This includes unit tests for individual components, integration tests for interactions between components, and end-to-end tests for user-facing functionality. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is strongly encouraged.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface and experience shall be consistent across all parts of the application. This includes command naming, flag conventions, output formatting, and error handling. The goal is to provide a predictable and intuitive user experience.

### IV. Performance by Design
Performance is a key feature. All new code and changes must be designed with performance in mind. This includes considerations for latency, resource consumption, and scalability. Performance testing should be integrated into the development process.

## Governance
This Constitution is the supreme governing document for this project. All development practices, code contributions, and reviews must comply with its principles. Amendments to this Constitution require a formal proposal, review, and approval process, and must be documented in a new version.
